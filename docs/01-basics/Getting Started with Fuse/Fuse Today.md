This section describes the current state of the Fuse platform before transitioning to the Fuse V2 stage, discussed in the next section.

It covers the following topics: the Fuse Network blockchain, its consensus mechanism, the native FUSE token, the current FUSE tokenomics and inflation, Fuse's payment-focused infrastructure, and the platform governance and improvement proposals.

Users wishing to start their journey on Fuse are invited to consult the [Interacting with Fuse](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-LdmeTBjede0-BcSd0W0/s/goUiB6chXvy8iVhpHHNd/interacting-with-fuse) chapter.
