Until today, the development of Fuse as a payment-focused blockchain platform has primarily relied on the infrastructure (middleware stack) created by Fuse Labs. This was sufficient to carry us quite far.

Still, priming Fuse for mass business and consumer adoption requires that the infrastructure on top of the Fuse Network blockchain become more robust and decentralized. The Fuse Network blockchain itself will also need to undergo changes and off-load most transactions to the second layer(s)

Hence, the transition to Fuse V2 will involve the following main components:

### Power Validators

Introducing Power Validators, or providers, incentivized on-chain to provide verifiably essential middleware services at a certain quality level.

### A ZKP layer for privacy and scaling

We are adding a zero-knowledge proof-based second layer to enable private transactions and boost scalability.

#### A new consensus

The move to a new consensus mechanism for the Fuse Network blockchain.

## Fuse Today vs. Fuse V2

As laid out in more detail in the Fuse Today section, the platform currently has two key components: the Fuse Network blockchain and the payment-focused infrastructure.

These components fueled the emergence of a vibrant ecosystem that includes more traditional crypto projects and projects focusing on real-world payments and related services.

However, taking Fuse to a new level where it becomes primed for mass adoption by businesses and consumers requires adding other vital components.

These will include strong incentives for the providers of essential infrastructure services and operators onboarding users to Fuse, switching to a new consensus mechanism, and adding a privacy layer.

Please refer to the Fuse V2 section for a more detailed overview of the upcoming transition.
