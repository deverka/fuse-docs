Many businesses and users need privacy to embrace web3 payments for their everyday needs. They want to be able to send and receive private transactions and conceal their balances from the public.

However, privacy had not been the focus of public blockchains for too long, and the technology wasn't mature yet. This is starting to change, as we see in the coming of age of the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology.

ZKPs make it possible to off-chain transactions quickly and securely while also keeping them private but auditable.

Moving most of the transactions off-chain (away from layer 1) will also help solve the scalability issue. In the Fuse vision, most of the transactions will happen off-chain. The layer-1 Fuse Network blockchain will secure the second layers, help verify private transactions and execute major value transfers.
