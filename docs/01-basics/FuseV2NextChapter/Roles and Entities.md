In Fuse 2.0, we introduce the following roles and entities that will be directly or indirectly involved in the ecosystem.

**Operators** - Operators are real-world business applications, games, Dapps, and anything that can be built on the Fuse stack. They develop and maintain applications that involve payments, are responsible for the seamless onboarding of users to the applications on Fuse, support their users, and follow the corresponding local regulations where they operate.

**Users** - End-users of the applications developed, managed, and maintained by the Operators. They are either customers or merchants. They want to pay or receive payments for products and services. They are not expected to be blockchain experts or tech-savvy.

**Power Validators** - run and maintain the payment infrastructure that the application is using to facilitate payments.

Every entity on the network is represented with a Smart Wallet Contract. The smart contracts enable extra functionality that can be injected via payment primitives.
