Fuse Assembly is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the Fuse platform to the community.

Fuse Assembly consists of five Fuse ecosystem members independent from Fuse Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project and already have a voice within the community.

Fuse Assembly's current role includes the following:

- taking over control of the Fuse Forum community discussion platform;
- implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on Fuse; and
- promoting ecosystem growth.
