## FUSE utilities

- **Transaction fees**: Being the native currency on the Fuse Network blockchain, users must pay fees in FUSE to approve transactions.
- **Validation**: Token holders can stake FUSE to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K FUSE. While the network is continuously growing, currently, there are 60+ validators.
- **Voting**: Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked FUSE and with the tokens delegated to them by stakers. This means validators with higher amounts of Fuse staked can have a more significant vote on network upgrades and governance changes.
- **Staking (for delegators)**: Any FUSE holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount they wish. They receive a share of the Fuse block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
- **Payments**: As FUSE is the native currency on Fuse Network, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, FUSE transfers are potentially faster and less costly regarding transaction fees.

:::danger IMPORTANT

Merely possessing any amount of FUSE tokens does not grant holders any rights to participate in the governance of the Fuse Network platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.
