As mentioned in the Vision sub-section, the Fuse platform primarily focuses on the Web3 payments vertical.

However, the evidence so far suggests that the mere existence of blockchains powering peer-to-peer transactions is insufficient to ensure the broad adoption of Web3 payments.

The Fuse team has, thus, been developing and iterating on a multi-faceted infrastructure that would enable businesses to integrate web3 payments into their products seamlessly.

## The infrastructure comprises the following main components:

1. Forkable and customizable Fuse Wallet frontend platform and its SDK.
2. The Charge API-based platform.
3. Smart contracts on Fuse Network that power smart wallet accounts, tokens, fee abstraction, and other components used by (1) and (2).
4. The official Fuse RPC endpoint and its supporting nodes.
5. The relevant subgraphs powered by The Graph protocol.
6. Fuse Explorer

It should be noted that some of the components of this stack are not only utilized as a part of the payment-centric infrastructure but are also open to and help other applications be deployed and run on the Fuse Network blockchain.

If you are a developer or a business wishing to research or implement web3 payments, Fuse's current infrastructure stack is described in more technical detail in the Fuse Stack section.

In the subsequent parts of this section, we will briefly discuss the fundamental principles on which the workings of the Fuse payment-focused infrastructure are based.
